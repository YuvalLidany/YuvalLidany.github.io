<p> <strong>(In)Compatibility of technology products: smartphones and laptops in the U.S. market</strong>.</p>
 <br> <br>
Compatibility between standalone technology products is an inconspicuous attribute that can anchor consumers to ecosystems. This paper studies the effect of compatibility between smartphones and laptops in the U.S. market. I first formulate a methodology enabling researchers to identify the causality of deep parameters. I then develop and estimate a structural model of smartphone (laptop) demand conditional on the owned laptop (smartphone) to quantify the effects of excluding incompatibility and allowing a cross-market merger. Variation in owned products identifies the compatibility coefficient.
