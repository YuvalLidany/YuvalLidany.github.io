<p> <strong>Product Compatibility Lock-In and Market Power: The Case of Smartphones and Laptops</strong>. (JMP)</p>

This paper examines the role of compatibility between <i>standalone</i> technology products, such as smartphones and laptops, in anchoring consumers to ecosystems in the U.S. market. I introduce a novel experimental design that elicits willingness to pay for a smartphone both before and after a potentially compatible laptop is gifted to the participant, revealing a compatibility value of \$88. This approach enables the identification of the causal impact of deep parameters. This supports the development of a structural model of demand for smartphones, which incorporates compatibility characteristics with laptops to quantify the impacts of opened ecosystems and cross-market mergers. Counterfactual analysis shows that opened ecosystems increase market concentration when the hardware quality gap is considerable, and vice versa. Consumer surplus increases due to lower prices and a wider variety of compatible products. A cross-market merger between Samsung and HP decreases market concentration but leads to higher prices set by the merged entity due to cross-market power, resulting in a heterogeneous effect on consumer surplus.
