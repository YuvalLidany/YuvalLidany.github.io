<p> <strong>Product Compatibility Lock-In and Market Power: The Case of Smartphones and Laptops</strong>. (JMP)</p>

This paper examines the role of compatibility across <i>standalone</i> technology products in anchoring consumers to brands. Through a novel experimental design that elicits willingness to pay for a smartphone both before and after a laptop is gifted to the participant, I identify the causal impact of compatibility: smartphone valuations increase by 11% more when the randomly gifted laptop is compatible. I use the experimental results to estimate a model of smartphone demand that incorporates compatibility with laptops. I quantify the effects of regulations requiring cross-brand compatibility (i.e., “open ecosystems”) and cross-market mergers. Open ecosystems counterfactual reveals that in 2018-2019, when Apple hardware quality is significantly higher, smartphone market concentration rises as non-Apple laptop owners switch to Apple smartphones due to Apple's superior compatibility. In 2020-2023, with a narrowed hardware quality gap, smartphone market concentration decreases as Apple laptop owners opt for Samsung devices, given unchanged compatibility. In both cases, consumer surplus rises due to lower prices and a wider variety of compatible products. Counterfactual merger between Samsung and HP, Apple's main smartphone and laptop rivals, respectively, reduces smartphone market concentration but leads to higher prices set by the merged entity due to its cross-market power. The higher prices have a heterogeneous impact on consumer surplus, with those valuing compatibility less being worse off.
