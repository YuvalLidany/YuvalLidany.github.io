<p> <strong>Product Compatibility Lock-In and Market Power: The Case of Smartphones and Laptops</strong>.</p>

This paper investigates the role of compatibility between standalone technology products, such as smartphones and laptops, in anchoring consumers to ecosystems in the U.S. market. I design a novel experimental methodology that elicits willing- ness to pay for goods both before and after a potentially compatible good is gifted to the participant, finding a compatibility value of $88. This approach allows for the identification of the causal impact of deep parameters and the development of a structural model of demand for smartphones and laptops, incorporating compatibility characteristics to quantify the impacts of opened ecosystems and cross-market mergers. Variation in consumer ownership identifies the compatibility coefficient. Counterfactual analysis reveals that opened ecosystems increase market concentration when the mean hardware quality gap is considerable, and vice versa. Consumer surplus increases due to lower prices and a wider variety of compatible products. The cross-market merger results in lower market concentration but higher prices by the merged entity, leading to a heterogeneous effect on consumer surplus.
