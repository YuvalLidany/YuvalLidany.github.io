<p> <strong>Compatibility-Induced Lock-in of Technology Products: Smartphones and Laptops in the U.S. Market</strong>.</p>
  
This paper investigates the role of compatibility between <em>standalone<em> technology products, such as smartphones and laptops, in anchoring consumers to ecosystems in the U.S. market. I design a novel experimental methodology that elicits willingness to pay for goods, both before and after a potentially compatible good is gifted to the participant. This approach allows us to identify the causal impact of deep parameters and develop a structural model of demand for smartphones and laptops, incorporating compatibility characteristics. The model quantifies the impacts of opened ecosystems and cross-market mergers. Variation in consumer ownership identifies the compatibility coefficient. Counterfactual analysis reveals that opened ecosystems increase market concentration when the hardware quality gap is considerable and vice versa. Consumer surplus increases due to lower prices and a wider variety of compatible products.
