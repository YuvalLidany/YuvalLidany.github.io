<p> <strong>(In)Compatibility of Technology Products: Smartphones and Laptops in The U.S. Market</strong>.</p>
  
This paper investigates the role of compatibility between <em>standalone<em> technology products, such as smartphones and laptops, in anchoring consumers to ecosystems in the U.S. market. I design a novel methodology to identify the causal impacts of deep parameters and develop a structural model of demand for smartphones and laptops, incorporating compatibility characteristics. This model quantifies the impact of opened ecosystems and cross-market mergers. Variation in consumer ownership identifies the compatibility coefficient. Counterfactual reveals that opened ecosystems increase market concentration when the hardware quality gap is considerable and vice versa, where consumer surplus increases due to lower prices and higher compatibility.
