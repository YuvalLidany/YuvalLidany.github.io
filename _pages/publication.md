<p> <strong>Cross-Product Compatibility, Lock-In, and Market Power: The Case of Smartphones and Laptops</strong>. (JMP)</p>

This paper examines the role of compatibility across <i>standalone</i>  technology products in anchoring consumers to brands. Using a novel experiment that elicits smartphone willingness to pay before and after participants are gifted a laptop, I identify the causal impact of compatibility: smartphone valuations increase by 11% when the laptop is compatible. I then estimate a smartphone demand model incorporating compatibility and assess the effects of regulations mandating cross-brand compatibility (&ldquo;open ecosystems&rdquo;) and cross-market mergers. In 2018-2019, closed ecosystems benefit Samsung, as non-Apple laptop owners are locked into lower-quality Samsung smartphones, while open ecosystems boost Apple’s revenue and market share. In 2020-2023, closed ecosystems benefit Apple, as Samsung’s top smartphones are superior, prompting Apple laptop owners to opt for Samsung smartphones in open ecosystems. In both periods, consumer surplus rises due to lower prices and greater product variety. A counterfactual Samsung-HP merger, Apple's main competitors in the smartphone and laptop markets, reduces smartphone market concentration but raises Samsung-HP smartphone prices, negatively impacting consumers who value compatibility less.
